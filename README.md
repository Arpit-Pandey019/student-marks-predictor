## 📌 About This Project

This is a complete end-to-end Machine Learning web application that predicts student marks based on study hours.

I built this project to understand how ML models are trained, integrated into a backend, and deployed to production using cloud platforms.

This project demonstrates both Machine Learning and Deployment skills.

##  What This Project Does

- Takes **Study Hours** as input  
- Uses **Linear Regression Model**  
- Predicts **Student Marks**  
- Displays output on a clean web interface  

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- 🐍 Python  
- 📊 Scikit-Learn  
- 🔢 NumPy  
- 🌐 Flask  
- 🚀 Gunicorn  
- ☁️ Render (Cloud Deployment)  
- 🗂 Git & GitHub  

---

## 🔄 Complete Project Workflow (Simple Explanation)

### 1️⃣ Model Training
- Created dataset (Study Hours vs Marks)
- Trained Linear Regression model
- Saved model using `pickle`

### 2️⃣ Backend Development
- Built Flask application
- Created home route `/`
- Created prediction route `/predict`
- Loaded trained model
- Returned prediction to frontend

### 3️⃣ Frontend Development
- Designed responsive UI using HTML & CSS
- Centered layout
- Clean card design
- Displayed predicted marks beside label

### 4️⃣ Version Control
- Initialized Git repository
- Pushed code to GitHub

### 5️⃣ Deployment
- Connected GitHub repository to Render
- Configured:
  - Build Command → `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - Start Command → `gunicorn app:app`
- Successfully deployed production-ready application
